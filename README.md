# Foundry-Fund-Me
Hey Folks, this is project is a funding smart contract where you can raise funds for yourself in a web3 compliant way using foundry and solidity.
In this project i also used Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface (priceconverter.sol) for converting and fetching real time ETH/USD price. This project contains FundMe.sol with main source code and a library PriceConverter.sol. It also contains a small deploy script in foundry and a test file FundMeTest.t.sol which contains some unit tests.
